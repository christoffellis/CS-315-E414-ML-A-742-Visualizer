# CS 315/E414/ML-A 742 Visualizer

This tool is designed to help you visualize the output of the various algorithms 
developed in CS 315/E414/ML-A 742. 

It is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
 - Pygame
 - Numpy
 - Scipy

Some helper libraries are implemented to ensure that each algorithm is implemented
the way it would outside of this course.
`hmmlearn`
`sklearn.mixture._gaussian_mixture`
`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`
